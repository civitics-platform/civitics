## Phase 1 — MVP `Weeks 3–10` `~65% complete` ← **current**

> **Done when:** Search works, homepage shows real data for all sections (proposals link live, not `href="#"`), one complete user journey end to end (search → official → vote record → donor → connection graph), auth working, 500 beta users, grant applications submitted.

### Data Ingestion Pipelines
- [x] Congress.gov API → officials + votes (`packages/data/src/pipelines/congress/`)
- [x] FEC bulk pipeline → `weball24.zip` download → parse → match → upsert → auto-run connections (`packages/data/src/pipelines/fec-bulk/`)
  - Note: FEC API-based pipeline (`fec/`) retained for reference but must not be used — hits rate limits
- [x] FEC Individuals bulk file pipeline (`packages/data/src/pipelines/financial-entities/`) — creates `financial_entities` table rows from FEC donor categories
  - Note: Full 2GB individual-level FEC file pending Cloudflare R2 account
- [x] USASpending.gov → spending_records (`packages/data/src/pipelines/usaspending/`)
- [x] Regulations.gov → proposals + comment periods (`packages/data/src/pipelines/regulations/`)
- [x] OpenStates → state legislators (`packages/data/src/pipelines/openstates/`)
- [x] CourtListener → judges + rulings (`packages/data/src/pipelines/courtlistener/`)
- [x] Entity connections pipeline — derives donation/vote/oversight/appointment from ingested data (`packages/data/src/pipelines/connections/`)
- [x] Master orchestrator + scheduler (`packages/data/src/pipelines/index.ts`)
- [x] Sync log tracking — `data_sync_log` table, per-pipeline run records

### Core Pages
- [x] Homepage wired to real data — officials, proposals, agencies, spending counts pulled live from Supabase
  - Note: Proposals and Agencies nav links still `href="#"` (no `/proposals/` or full `/agencies/` browse page yet)
- [x] Officials list page (`/officials`) — full list, party filter, real data
- [x] Official detail page (`/officials/[id]`) — votes, donor data, real data
- [x] Agency list page (`/agencies`) — real data
- [x] Agency detail page (`/agencies/[slug]`) — real data
- [ ] Proposals list + detail page — route does not exist (`/proposals/` and `/proposals/[id]` missing)
- [ ] Search — no search component or API route exists anywhere in the app
- [x] Public accountability dashboard (`/dashboard`) — platform stats, pipeline health, data counts

### Graph Features
- [x] Connection graph with D3 force simulation (`packages/graph/src/ForceGraph.tsx`)
- [x] Graph page at `/graph` — dark theme, wired to `entity_connections` table via `/api/graph/connections`
- [x] Share code system — `CIV-XXXX-XXXX` codes, `/graph/[code]` URLs, `graph_snapshots` table, `/api/graph/snapshot` route
- [x] Screenshot export — PNG 1×/2×/4× with non-removable watermark (URL + data sources + date)
- [x] 5 of 8 preset views built — Follow the Money, Votes & Bills, Revolving Door, Full Picture, Clean View
  - Not yet built: Committee Power, Industry Capture, Co-Sponsor Network
- [x] Ghost node empty state animation — shown when `entity_connections` table is empty
- [x] Entity selector — search-as-you-type for officials, agencies, proposals; centers graph on selection
- [x] Depth control — 1–5 hop selector; client-side BFS filter
- [x] Filter pills — per-connection-type toggles with live counts; syncs with presets; "Custom" badge
- [x] Customize panel — node size/color encoding, edge thickness/opacity, layout, theme
- [x] Node types rendered: official (circle), proposal (document rect), corporation/financial (diamond, green), pac (triangle, orange), individual (dashed circle, blue), governing_body (rounded rect, purple)
  - Note: `entity_connections` schema uses `from_id`/`from_type`/`to_id`/`to_type` — different from original CLAUDE.md spec which showed `entity_a_id`/`entity_b_id`
- [ ] AI narrative ("Explain this graph") — not yet built
- [ ] Path finder (shortest path between two entities) — Phase 2
- [ ] Timeline scrubber — Phase 2
- [ ] Comparison mode (split screen) — Phase 2

### Infrastructure
- [x] Supabase storage buckets created
- [x] Storage utility (`packages/db/src/storage.ts`) — `uploadFile()` / `getFile()` / `getStorageUrl()`, path-based (migration-ready for R2)
- [x] `data_sync_log` table tracking all pipeline runs
- [x] `api_usage_logs` table
- [x] `ai_summary_cache` table — entity-based cache for AI summaries (migration 0005)
- [x] `service_usage` table — tracks Mapbox loads, R2 ops, Vercel deploys (migration 0006)
- [x] `financial_entities` table (created after main schema — types not yet regenerated)
- [x] `graph_snapshots` table (created after main schema — types not yet regenerated)
  - TODO: run `pnpm --filter @civitics/db gen:types` to regenerate `database.ts` and remove the `any` casts in graph API routes
- [x] Vercel Analytics + Speed Insights — installed, wired into root layout
- [x] Cloudflare R2 — buckets created (`civitics-documents`, `civitics-cache`), storage.ts updated to use @aws-sdk/client-s3, STORAGE_PROVIDER=r2 active
- [ ] Custom storage domain

### Database (as of 2026-03-16 audit)
- [x] `entity_connections` — 2,212 rows
- [x] `officials` — 1,983 rows
- [x] `proposals` — 1,917 rows
- [x] `spending_records` — 1,980 rows
- [x] `votes` — 226,873 rows
- [x] `financial_entities` — FEC donor categories seeded
- [x] `graph_snapshots` — table exists, rows created on share
- [x] `civic_comments` — table exists, no commenting UI yet

### AI Features
- [x] Plain language bill summaries — `generateSummary()` in `packages/ai/src/client.ts`, Haiku model, cache + $4.00/month cost guard, logs to `api_usage_logs`
- [ ] Basic credit system in Supabase
- [ ] "What does this mean for me" personalized query

### Community & Auth

- [ ] Position tracking on proposals
- [ ] Follow officials and agencies

### Maps
- [x] Mapbox account + API key — NEXT_PUBLIC_MAPBOX_TOKEN configured
